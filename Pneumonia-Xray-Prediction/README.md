# Pneumonia-Xray-Prediction
Pneumonia-Xray-prediction model trained using X-ray imgaes . We used CNN algrtihm to extract feature from Images and train our model based on that paramater


## DATASET

### Live Model Deployed on Heroku :- https://covid-xray-detection.herokuapp.com/

### Dataset is collected from Kaggle  
* [Pneumonia Dataset Data](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) X-ray images for healthy people from kaggle

## General info
Pneumonia-Xray-prediction model trained using X-ray imgaes . We used CNN algrtihm to extract feature from Images and train our model based on that paramater

	
## Things used
Project is created with:
* On: Google Colab
* Python
* CNN to train Model

##Setup for Running it is local app ( deployed model) 

* Clone the repo
* Install requirements.txt 
* Run wsgi.py (you will.be ready to go ) 

( These are the steps to run A single model locally )
