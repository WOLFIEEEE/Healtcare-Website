## DATASET

### Live Model Deployed on Heroku :- https://covid-xray-detection.herokuapp.com/

* Dataset is collected from two diiferent places 
* [Covid-Patient Data](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) X-ray Images for covid positive patient from Github
* [Normal People Data](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) X-ray images for healthy people from kaggle
* [Merged Data](https://www.kaggle.com/khushwantparihar/covid-detectionxray-images) Merged data set (that I used in my project)

## General info
This is a model that detect whether the patient is Normal or covid positive based on their X-ray of chest. We used the data from github to train our model.It's not practically possible to implement this in real life because one probability doesn't work in real life.One wrong prediction and it may cost a life. I used CNN to train my model which given me approx accuracy of 98 percent. Although you are free to use any model you want
